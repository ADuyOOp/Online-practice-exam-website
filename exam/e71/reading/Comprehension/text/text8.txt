Lagrange Clothing to open European stores

November 7——Radcliffe, CEO of Lagrange Clothing, today announced his intention to take the thriving clothing retail business into international markets, with flagship European retail stores set to open in London, Paris, and Berlin. Construction has already begun on a new manufacturing plant and distribution warehouse in Brussels, Belgium, and these are expected to begin operations in early February, just one month before the opening of the flagship stores.

This year has proven to be a banner year for Lagrange Clothing and saw Mr. Radcliffe attend the opening of the company’s newest retail location in downtown Houston. “We’ve enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last few years,” he told gathered journalists today. “By moving operations into foreign markets for the first time, we aim to establish ourselves as one of the world’s leading clothing manufacturers.”

Today’s announcement will likely see a boost to the company’s share price, with financial analysts forecasting a 50% increase by the end of next week. This will undoubtedly bring even more attention to the firm, and it is expected that sales will continue to soar over the coming year.

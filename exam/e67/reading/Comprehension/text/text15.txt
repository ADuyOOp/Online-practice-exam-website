Dear Mr. Maher,

Earlier today you called to report that you have experienced problems with the picture quality of your cable television service over the past few days. After looking into this matter, we discovered that a junction box near your location was in need of repairs, and we sent out a crew to fix it. We have repaired the problem and expect that you have already noticed a marked improvement in the quality of your picture.
We sincerely apologize for difficulties you were experiencing with our service. We value you as a customer and will be mailing you a $15 gift card for QCV Cinemas. The card should arrive within the next two weeks and can be used at any QCV cinema in the province. Thank you again for choosing Choice Cable as your Cable Television provider.

Sincerely,
Brooke Moorefield

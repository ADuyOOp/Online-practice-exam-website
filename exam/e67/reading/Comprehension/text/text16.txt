FAIRMOUNT - Luigi's Kitchen will be open for business on Thursday, May 1st. Luigi's is another welcome addition to the many fine dining establishments located in Fairmount's waterfront district. Head Chef Luigi San Gregorio says, "Luigi's specializes in fine Italian cuisine derived from his native upbringing in Rome. This delicious yet fairly common cuisine will be prepared to the highest possible standards using the finest ingredients. Customers can expect the freshest pasta, meats and seasonal vegetables. Our goal is to complete customer satisfaction and to ensure that they return over and over again."

San Gregorio, formerly head chef at Chez Mario's, began making a plan to open his own restaurant in Fairmount over two years ago. He evaluated several locations around the area but was set on the waterfront district. He ended up leasing space in the former garment warehouse building and helped pay for the renovations. San Gregorio added, "I worked closely with special architects and city planners to ensure that most of the original structure was preserved and in line with current city zoning laws. We wanted to respect the rich history of this area."

Luigi's is spectacular inside and out. It remains to be seen whether the food is as appealing as the decoration. Luigi's Kitchen will be open Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner. The menu offers a wide selection of pricing options with the average price of a dinner being comparable to most restaurants in the waterfront district.

W: Everyone’s here now. Is dinner ready to be served?
M: I’m afraid there has been some miscommunications in the schedule. I just spoke with the caterer on the phone, and he thought the food was to be ready by 8 o’clock.
W: Eight? But we told them dinner would be at 6:30. They must have mistaken it for the presentation time. Oh well, I guess we’ll have to change our plans and watch the presentation first.

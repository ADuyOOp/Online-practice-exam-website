Youâ€™ve reached NYC Electricity. This announcement is being recorded at 9:30 P.M., Thursday, July 7th. Most of you are still having trouble due to the power failure caused by the big storm last night. At the moment, many engineers are working hard to fix this problem, and we greatly apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused you. We now expect the service to be back to normal by tomorrow morning. There will be updated announcements hourly throughout the night. So for more information, give us a call. Thank you.

Good evening, and welcome to the Lucero Theater. Tonight’s performance of La Traviata will begin at 7:20 P.M. instead of 7:00 P.M. as some of our singers arrived at the theater late because of the icy roads. We sincerely apologize for the delay, and we thank you for your patience. In the meantime, please visit the table near the main entrance, where our staff is selling professionally produced copies of the soundtrack from the performance. On the back of your programs you will find details of our theater’s membership program, which we encourage you to join. Without the generous support from our members, we wouldn’t be able to stay in operation.

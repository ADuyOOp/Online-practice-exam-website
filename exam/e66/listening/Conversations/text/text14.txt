M: Hi. l’m calling about my dishwasher. I purchased it just last week, but it appears to be malfunctioning. It makes an unusual noise when it’s running, and the dishes are not clean at the end of the cycle. The model is TR745, and my customer ID number is 49392.
W： Okay. 1’m going to send out a message to Joshua, our repairperson, right away. He’s just finishing up another project now, so he could visit your home in about an hour We have your address listed as 1882 Virginia Street. Is that correct?
M： Yes. And I’ll be home all afternoon.
W： All right. In the meantime, 1 suggest you empty the dishwasher before he arrives. That way, it will be easier for him to investigate the problem.

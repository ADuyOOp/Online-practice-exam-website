M: Good afternoon. This is Jerry Stevens. I bought a bedside lamp from your Web site last week, but it hasn’t been delivered yet. I paid for overnight shipping, so I’m really dissatisfied with the slow service.
W： Oh, I’m very sorry about that. I can check our system to find out the reason for the delay. Could you tell me the invoice number at the top of the receipt that was e-mailed to you?
M： It’s 3529. And I’d really like to get my item as soon as possible.
W： I understand. I’ll notify our warehouse team right away. And of course we will refund the fee for the overnight shipping. We will also send you a universal dimmer switch to accompany your lamp free of charge as well. Sorry once again, and thank you for your patience.

M: Iâ€™m glad to see that everyone was able to make it today. Our first order of business, before the presentations, is to offer our sincere appreciation to Dr. Darren Heinz, who was the top donor to the Bright Future Research Foundation. Thanks to his generous contribution, our poverty research team will be able to continue numerous projects. Their work for the past fifteen years has been at the forefront of this field, and this money will allow the development of new initiatives to better assist disadvantaged children and teenagers. We are so pleased that we reached our fundraising goal this year. We hope all of you will be able to attend a celebratory dinner to honor Dr. Heinz and our other supporters at the Eagle Club on November 12.

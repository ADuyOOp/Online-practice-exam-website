Ladies and gentlemen, the next point of interest on the tour is the winery in California. Our tour bus should arrive at Coppola Winery in about an hour. Before we enter the production area, there are a few things I'd like to mention. Most of you probably know that Coppola has been around for a long time. In fact, we are about to celebrate our 60th anniversary. More to the point, that makes us one of the oldest wine manufacturers in the country. I'll take you around the factory to show how our products are made. For your protection, smoking is prohibited. Furthermore, you are required to wear safety goggles and gloves in the specific area.

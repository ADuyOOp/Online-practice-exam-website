M: Welcome to Language Today on KXRP Radio. I’m Ted Costello, and I’ll be your host this hour. For today’s show, I’m thrilled to be interviewing language specialist Dr. Eric Alfson right here in the studio. Dr. Alfson has recently completed groundbreaking research into child language acquisition in bilingual homes. He has agreed to tell us about the surprising results even before his new book hits stores on August 4. Dr. Alfson, it’s a pleasure to welcome you to this program.

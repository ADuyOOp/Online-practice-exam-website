W: Aiden, when did you start working out at A&B Gym? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you here before.
M： Actually, I joined yesterday, and today is my first visit. I’m planning to run my first marathon in a few months, and (38)1 heard this gym has modern treadmills and an indoor track. I thought having a few options would help me prepare better.
W: Absolutely. They also have group classes. You might be interested in the Marathon Training for Beginners class. I’m taking it myself, and 1 can give you my timetable. If you want to join, you can just come to the next session.

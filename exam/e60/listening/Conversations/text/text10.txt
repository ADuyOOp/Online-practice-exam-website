W: Mr. Heath, I want to talk about scheduling interviews for the web-design position.
M: Oh, yes. I’ll be at work only on Wednesday and Thursday next week, because I will be on a business trip.
W: Hmm, I have a conference to attend on Wednesday, so I don’t think I’ll be at the office that day.
M: Well, what about doing the interviews on Thursday before I leave?
W: Okay. I guess only Thursday works for both of us. We really need to hire someone as quickly as possible.
M: Right, it’s urgent. The clients are starting to complain about the old designs of our website.

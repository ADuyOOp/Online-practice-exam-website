He is such a funny guy.

Mary Ammon

Right! He sure is a great comedian. I wish I had watched it.

John Tylor

Oh, in that case, you can see it tomorrow! I heard they’re rebroadcastingit at 9PM. on the same channel.

Mary Ammon

Really? That’s great! I should write it down somewhere, in case I forget.

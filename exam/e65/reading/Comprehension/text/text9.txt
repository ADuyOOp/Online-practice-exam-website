To All Tenants,

Please be advised that the water supply to the entire apartment complex will be shut off between the hours of 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. tomorrow. This is to enable the replacement of some old pipes, which have become corroded and fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair.
The plumbing company has requested that all tenants take precautions prior to tomorrow's start time, as changes in water pressure can cause problems when the water supply is reactivated. To avoid any such problems from affecting you or your apartment, please ensure that:
• All faucets are switched firmly to the 'off position.

• Plugs are removed from all sinks and baths to prevent flooding in the event of high water pressure.
• Toilets in your unit are not used throughout these hours. Toilets in the lobby will be available as normal.
We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause and appreciate your understanding while this essential work is carried out.

Regards,

Trevor Francis
Superintendent
Everlove Apartments

Subject: Eugene Pippen

Hello Everyone,
As I discussed briefly in last week’s staff meeting, Eugene Pippen, the company’s public relations director, has resigned from his role here at Virginia Consulting. Mr. Pippen has decided to ---1--- a position with a major investment group, Haymond Investments.

This job will allow Mr. Pippen to plan publicity campaigns on a larger scale. ---2---. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity for him both professionally and personally. ---3---, we are sincerely disappointed to lose him as an employee.

Mr. Pippen’s final day of work will be Wednesday, March 18. On that day, we will hold a small ceremony in the main conference room ---4--- his many years of service. It will begin at 4 P.M., and everyone is welcome to attend.

Cheers,
Naomi Mizell

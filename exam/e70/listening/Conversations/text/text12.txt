M: Oh. Hi, Elizabeth. It’s Edward. I’m sorry I haven’t seen you for so long. 1’ve been setting up a display of Spencer Boyle’s poems and letters at the library, and it’s been taking up a lot of my time.
W:1 completely understand. I know you have a lot to do. I’m glad to hear about the new display, though, because I need to gather information on contemporary poets for my evening class at the community center.
M： Well, in that case, how about I arrange to give you a personalized viewing of the display? There are several rare documents that might be of interest to you.
W: That would be fantastic. It would really help me out. And since you know so much about it, you would be the perfect guide.

W: Excuse me. When will we reach New Street Station in Birmingham? I have to transfer there to get to Leicester.
M: We just passed Coventry, so we should be there in about forty minutes. The stop will be announced three minutes before arrival.
W： I see. Last time I made a transfer there I got lost in the station. I ended up having to ask a cafe worker for directions. Do you offer any guide services?
M： Not formally, but we certainly don’t want any of our passengers to get lost. 1 can bring you a map of the station when I come through again in a few minutes. That will help you follow the color-coded signs in the station.

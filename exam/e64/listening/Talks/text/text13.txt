Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen. On behalf of all the staff here at Ray Telecommunications, I want to thank you all for coming to our client appreciation banquet. We have invited you here tonight to show our gratitude for your patronage. First, you will enjoy a fantastic dinner, with the kinds of dishes you may not have had in recent months. After that, we invite you to an exciting dance party in the ballroom. The famous group, Glenn Cross and His Band, will be performing some great jazz music. As you leave the party, be sure to pick up a gift basket arranged especially for our preferred clients. Once again, I would like to express my gratitude. This has been our best financial year so far—something we would not have been able to achieve without you. Thank you all very much for being such loyal Ray Telecommunications’ customers.

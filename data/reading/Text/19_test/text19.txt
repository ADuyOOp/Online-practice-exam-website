Subject: Mailing problem

Dear Laura,
I’d just like to fill you in about a complaint we ---1--- from Mrs. Tanaka of Visionary Designs. She said that she was waiting on one of our living room furniture catalogues on Tuesday, but they had not arrived. Thankfully, she didn’t seem to mind so I immediately sent her the catalogues by express delivery.

---2---. I suggest ---3--- one person to be exclusively in charge of mailing out catalogues to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.

Please reply with your opinion about my ---4---.

Thanks,
Ayaka

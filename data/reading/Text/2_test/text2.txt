Subject: Spelling error on Lambert posters

Hi Vincent,
It’s just come to my attention that there’s been a setback with the Lambert project. Apparently the posters for their product launch contain a (1)____.

The company name was typed incorrectly in the heading on the final version. As the liaison for this client, I need you to contact Mr. Lambert, notify him of the issue, and (2) ___ for the oversight.

Because we were responsible for this error, please reassure Mr. Lambert that reprinting of the posters will occur at (3) ___ expense and will be completed by the end of next week.
(4) ____.

Regards,
Joseph Craig Production Manager, TJR Printing

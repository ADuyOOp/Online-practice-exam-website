Dear All,
As of Monday next week, changes are being made to the supply ordering process. Copies of all supply orders for stationery are ---1--- forwarded to the purchasing department but should now be sent to your department head for approval instead.

For managers, we ask that you ---2--- the expenditures required each week and keep a running total. ---3---. If the new system proves to be successful, as we expect it will, we will implement it across all purchasing sectors. Updates will be given to your team leaders ---4--- as they become available.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Doris Edwards
Manager, Purchasing Department

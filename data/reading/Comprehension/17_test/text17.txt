Hi, all! How about taking in a movie tonight?

Beth Hon
3:11 P.M.
Great!

Bill Johns

I’d like to, but my presentation is due next week and I should really work on that.

Steven Wallace
3:16 P.M.
I thought you had done all your research for that already.

Bill Johns
3:17 P.M.
I had, but I have trouble in trying to put the whole thing together.

Beth Hon
3:18 P.M.
Have you made your outline yet?

Bill Johns
3:20 P.M.
No, I don’t usually bother with that. I will arrange my research and my thought when I make my presentation.

Beth Hon
3:22 P.M.
Well, there’s your problem. If you write a clear outline with the main points, you can just plug in your facts to support your argument.

Steven Wallace
3:23 P.M.
I couldn’t agree more, Beth.

Bill Johns
3:25 P.M.
You’re probably right. I guess I should hammer out a good outline first. Thank you.

Can anyone help me with a problem that I’m having with my Viewsnap R-400 digital camera?

I own the same model. It’s intended for wildlife photography, so if you’re using it to take pictures indoors that might be why it’s not working as you want.

That isn’t my problem. I bought it because I take pictures for a nature magazine, so I know I’ve got the right model.

I’m responsible for repairs at Viewsnap. What exactly is your issue? I should be able to help you.

The shutter that covers the camera lens is stuck somehow. It only opens halfway when I turn the camera on. Obviously, I cannot take pictures.

Can’t you just return it to Viewsnap and have them give you a new camera?

I’m afraid not. My warranty has expired, so they won’t do anything about it.

I have dealt with this problem before. The issue is a fault in the shutter’s mechanism. Often, dust or particles become lodged among the components, which prevents the shutter from opening fully.

I remember this happening to me once as well! The technician took the back cover off completely, sprayed compressed air over the circuit board, and replaced the back panel.

Ms. Montero is correct. Those steps should resolve the issue.

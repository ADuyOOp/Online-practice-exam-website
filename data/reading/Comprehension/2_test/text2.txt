Dear Ms. Wan,
We regret to inform you that you have not been selected for the vehicle sales position you interviewed for last week. While we were impressed with your enthusiastic personality, we decided to hire someone with a more intimate knowledge of the individual makes and models in order to reduce the need for in-house training. You also mentioned that you are working mornings at a high- end boutique and that you would need to give at least 30 days' notice to your current employer. As we discussed in the interview, we need a full-time worker available as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Nahum Balashov HR Director, Zapata Cars

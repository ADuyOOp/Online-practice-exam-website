ear Ms. Elaine Feinstein,

Thank you for inquiring about the services offered by Stratford Advertising Agency (SAA). Enclosed is some information you requested including a brochure and some samples of our recent advertising campaigns.

Furthermore, I also included a list of companies that we are currently working with. You may already know that SAA manages the marketing and advertising for many different types of businesses, which gives these firms the opportunity to concentrate on other aspects of their operations.

To further assist our clients with their needs, we host a variety of presentations throughout the year that can be attended for a nominal fee. The next session, entitled “Staying Competitive in a Down Market,” is scheduled for Thursday, March 5, at 7:00 P.M. at our branch office on Freeman Avenue. At that event, you will have the opportunity to meet and talk with some of our satisfied clients. If you would like to attend, please call Ms. Lisa Vaughn at extension 207 to register for this event.

Please contact me if you would like to schedule a new client consultation or receive a price quote for our services. I am also available to meet with you in person if you prefer.

We look forward to doing business with you.

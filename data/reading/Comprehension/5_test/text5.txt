I'm setting up the conference room for the board meeting, but can't find the the cable for the laptop.

I'm not sure which cable you mean.

The one that hooks up a computer to the projector for videos and slideshows. I need one of those but it's missing.

DANNY OLSEN
13:14
Oh, that's happened before. Iâ€™ll bring one down in a few minutes.

DANNY OLSEN
13:15
Should I take anything else with me?

ELIZABETH TANNER

I think there's also a remote for the projector. I can't find that either.

DANNY OLSEN
13:20
I'll grab that as well.

ELIZABETH TANNER

I really appreciate it!

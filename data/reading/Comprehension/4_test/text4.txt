Greetings everyone,
This morning, we have received reports from various departments stating that the phone lines are down. We believe this has been caused by the lightning storm that occurred overnight. It seems that only the customer service, personnel, and marketing departments have been affected by this fault, with your phone lines in the sales department remaining unaffected. At this very moment, Terrence Preece from the IT department is working hard to restore full service to our phone network, and he is optimistic that this will be achieved by 6 P.M. today.

In the meantime, we ask that even those who are able to use your phones, please communicate with the affected departments using e-mail only. We understand the impact that this disruption will have on your productivity rates, but we are hopeful that you will do your best to work within the limitations presented.

Thank you for understanding.
Dean Glover
Network Manager

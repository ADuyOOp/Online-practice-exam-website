M: It’s great to see so much enthusiasm for your first day here at Blane Advertising. We’re glad you’ll be a part of our team. I’m sure you’re wondering exactly what your work will involve.

You will work on projects individually and then pass them on to Gary Eldon, our project lead. To make sure everyone is following the same criteria, we will start with some training. I’ll show you a brief video that highlights some of our best work, and then we’ll discuss it together.

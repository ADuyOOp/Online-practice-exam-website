W: Hi. This is Deidre Elliot calling with a message for the general manager. I purchased a dryer from your store earlier this week, and I wanted to tell you how pleased I was with your delivery person, Ivan Podolski. He arrived as scheduled and set up the dryer quickly. He was also careful to clean up all of the packaging before he left. I had not realized how many steps were involved in the set up, so I really appreciated his work. I will certainly be recommending you to my friends and will return myself for future purchases. Thank you for the excellent customer service I received.

W: Hi. This is Erin Gibbs calling for Clifford Johnston. I’m the one who visited your home earlier this week to discuss the renovation project for your basement. I checked with our supplier, and it will be no problem to get wood paneling that matches the type of wood used in your living room. However, you said that you needed everything finished by August 17. Unfortunately, I just found out that a few of our crew members will be using vacation time in August, so we’ll be short-staffed. If you would be able to have the work done at the end of August instead, 1 could give you a lower price. Please call me back at 555-4175 to let me know what you think. Thank you.

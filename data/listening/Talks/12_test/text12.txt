Hello, this is a message for Zac Efron. My name is Nadia Elena from the Human Resources Department at Medical center. I’m calling to let you know that we received your application and resume for the emergency room position. In order to complete the application process, I’d like to schedule an interview with you for next week. Please call my secretary at 670-555-3328, and let her know when you are available. After the interview, our head manager will finally make a decision.

Good morning. Before starting our meeting, I have a brief announcement to make. Our parking area is scheduled to be repaved, beginning tomorrow. Therefore, you won’t be able to park in the company parking lot until the repaving and inspection are completed. So, tomorrow and the two days following, the parking lot will be closed from 10 to 6. Please park elsewhere. If you choose to take the subway, our company’s shuttle buses will be available at the station. Also, the main entrance on Country Boulevard will be closed for these three days. So if you usually enter at Country Boulevard, please use the Redford Street entrance instead.

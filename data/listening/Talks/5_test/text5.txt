M: Researchers at the Minnesota Sleep Clinic are recruiting volunteers to participate in the largest-ever study about the effects of caffeine on sleep. Dr. Wendy Senequa, lead researcher for the project, said that participants will spend seven days at the clinic having their sleep patterns monitored and recorded. They will be required to consume varying amounts of caffeine over the test period and keep a detailed journal. The study is due to start in two months, so interested parties should visit www.sleepclinic.net to complete the application form and health survey before November 15.

W: Hello. This is Janet from Smithville Contracting. We’re running low on ceramic floor tiles, so I’m calling to find out what you charge for the 13-inch square tiles.
M： Let’s see. According to our database, we have those for sixty-nine cents each, and they come in white, cream, and gray.
Delivery is free, and we would have them to you in two business days.
W： That’s a very attractive price. Sadly, we’re nearly out, and we have a job that we need to finish by Thursday.
M： Since you’re in our local service area, I can refer you to our in-house delivery team. They offer delivery within two hours for a cost of thirty-five dollars.

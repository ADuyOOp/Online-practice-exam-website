M: Hi, Miranda. 1 wanted to get an update from you about how the development of the new robotics software is going. I was expecting to see a prototype demonstration today, but I’ve been told that you don’t have a working model yet.
W： I’m sorry, Tim, but no, I don’t. There is some kind of internal wiring error that keeps making the machine malfunction. I’ve taken it apart several times and cannot figure out why one part keeps freezing.
M： I’m sorry to hear that. I think the best thing for you to do is to consult with one of the senior engineers who can troubleshoot things more easily.

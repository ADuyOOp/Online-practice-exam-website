M: Excuse me. I’m looking for a new power cord. I was using my laptop at a cafe and someone stepped on the cord. So, it’s broken.
W: I can help you with that. What brand is it?
M: Ventura.
W: All right. Ventura has several versions, so I’ll need the model number. What’s the number?
M: Just a minute. I wrote it down. ... Um ... It’s version 652-C.
W: It’s a few years old, then.
M: Will that be a problem?
W: Probably not. We keep parts for older models on hand. And if we don’t have it, we can have it sent over from Sands Valley or Davis Ville.

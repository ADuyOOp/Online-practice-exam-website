W: Good morning, Roger. I just dropped by to give you the copy of the newspaper you said you wanted, the India Business Gazette. 1 picked it up at the newsstand on the way to the office.
M： Thanks so much. I can pay you back for it. Oh, I see the cover price has gone up, though. These days I’m considering purchasing an annual subscription. It seems to be much cheaper than getting individual copies.
W： I think that’s a good idea, since you seem to be a regular reader. Is there anything else you need before I go to the client meeting?
M： Not right now. Could you come back here around noon? I will have finished the annual report by then, and I’ll need you to take it to the post office this afternoon.

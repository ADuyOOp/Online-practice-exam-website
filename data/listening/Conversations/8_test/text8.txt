M1: Lauri, what a surprise! I didn’t know you were coming.
W: Oh, Hi! Long time no see!
M2: I was told that you moved from New York to London.
W: Right! I have lived in London for 10 years, so, I wasn’t going to, but I changed my mind. I just couldn’t get our 15th reunion out of my mind.
M1: Isn’t it so great to be back here after all these years?

M1: Do you remember when we won the first prize at the student chess tournament?
W: How can I forget that? It was one of the best moments in my college life.

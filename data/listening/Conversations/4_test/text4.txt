M: Long time no see, Janice. Did you like Greece?
W: Yeah, it was just great. My friends and I stayed at a cozy hotel in Athens for three weeks.
M: Oh, I remember last year when I visited Athens for business. I had a lot of free time so I enjoyed sightseeing. What about you?
W: Just for the first week. We mostly spent our time walking, lying, and resting on the beach near the hotel. We sometimes tried out new restaurants, too.

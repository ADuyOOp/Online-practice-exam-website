M: Mandy, Mr. Ransh just called me. He sounded pretty upset about not receiving any design blueprints yet. You'd better send him something soon.
W: Really? That's weird. I sent him a blueprint by e-mail last week!
M: Hmm. Are you sure? Maybe you sent it to the wrong e-mail address.
W: No. I have his correct address saved in my computer directory. Well, I should send him a blueprint again right away anyway.

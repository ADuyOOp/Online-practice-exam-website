M: I had a good look at your resume and cover letter, Ms. Landers. And I am willing to offer you a position as a sales representative at Indie Industries.
W: Oh, thank you Mr. Carper. I am grateful to accept your offer. I really wanted this opportunity to use my background in sales. I applied right away after seeing the newspaper advertisement for the job.
M: Well, you sure made a great choice there. Now I’ll introduce you to Ms. Clarkson in the Personnel Department for some papers you need to fill out. When do you think you can start working?

M: Hi, Kimmy. Do you have a minute to talk about the Technology Workshop?
W: I have a weekly meeting soon, but go ahead.
M: Actually, I need to discuss the refreshments for the workshop you’re holding next Friday. You asked me to call you back before I confirm the order.
W: Right. I want to make sure everything is perfect. As I told you, we expect 20 participants and will need some coffee, juice, and bagels for breakfast. As for lunch, we will need sandwiches and diet Coke. Everything’s clear, right?
M: Yes, perfect. I’ll place the order right away. The cost will be approximately 100 dollars.
W: Okay. Oh, I want one more thing. Let’s add some fruit to the lunch menu.
